    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit or class. It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposes the necessary functionalities through methods.\n",
    "Example: Think of a car. A car encapsulates various components such as the engine, transmission, brakes, and so on. These components are hidden from the outside world and interact with each other through well-defined interfaces like the steering wheel, pedals, and gear stick. The driver doesn't need to know the internal workings of the engine to drive the car; they only need to interact with these external interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it achieves its functionality.\n",
    "Example: Consider a TV remote control. The remote control abstracts the complexities of the TV's internal circuitry and operations into a simple set of buttons (like power, volume, channel, etc.). Users interact with the remote control without needing to understand the inner workings of the TV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reusability and helps in creating a hierarchical classification of classes.\n",
    "Example: Think of a class hierarchy for vehicles. At the top level, you might have a generic Vehicle class. Below that, you could have more specific classes like Car, Truck, and Motorcycle. Each of these subclasses inherits common attributes and behaviors from the Vehicle class (like start_engine() or stop_engine()), while also having their own unique features and functionalities\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability to take multiple forms. In OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms or types. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
    "Example: Consider a Shape class with a method area(). You can have subclasses like Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle, each implementing their own version of the area() method specific to their shape. When you call area() on an object of any of these subclasses, polymorphism ensures that the correct version of area() is executed based on the actual type of the object at runtime. For instance, calling area() on a Circle object would execute the area() method specific to circles."
